            <h2>What is Black Screen Testing?</h2>
            <p>Black screen testing refers to the process of filling your entire display with a solid black color to examine it for defects and irregularities. This method is widely used in quality control for new devices and ongoing checks for existing ones, providing a uniform canvas that makes imperfections stand out clearly.</p>

            <h2>Key Benefits of Black Screen Testing</h2>
            <p>Engaging in regular black screen tests offers numerous advantages for both casual users and professionals. Here are some of the primary benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Detection of Pixel Issues:</strong> A pure black background makes dead or stuck pixels visible as contrasting dots, allowing for timely repairs or returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment of Lighting Uniformity:</strong> It highlights backlight inconsistencies, such as bleeding or clouding, which can degrade image quality in darker scenes.</li>
                <li><strong>Identification of Physical Flaws:</strong> Dust particles, smudges, or minor scratches become apparent against the dark surface, prompting cleaning or protective measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Eye Health Support:</strong> By simulating low-light viewing conditions, it aids in adjusting settings to reduce strain during extended sessions in dim environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Optimization for Advanced Displays:</strong> On technologies like OLED, true black pixels draw minimal energy, contributing to longer battery life in portable devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Calibration Accuracy:</strong> Professionals in visual arts use it to fine-tune contrast and black levels, ensuring faithful color reproduction in their work.</li>
            </ul>
